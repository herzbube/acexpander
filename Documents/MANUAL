Expanding ACE archives
----------------------
When you launch AceXpander the first time after you have installed it
on your system, it displays a big main window with an empty table that
waits to be filled with ACE archive files. You can either place files
into the table by selecting the File-Open command, or by dragging files
from the Finder onto the table.

Each file in the table is displayed with its icon, its full path name,
and its state. The state expresses what AceXpander has done so far with
the archive. When a file is added to the table its state is "Queued"; this
means that AceXpander will try to expand the archive if you have selected it
and click on the "Expand selected" button.

If you have placed several files into the table you can select them all and
click on the "Expand selected" button to let AceXpander process one archive
after the other. While expansion is in progress, a spinning progress indicator
is visible and the "Cancel" button is active. The archive that is currently
being expanded is marked with the state "Processing". An archive that is
expanded successfully is marked with the state "Success", then the next archive
is being processed. If something goes wrong, the archive is marked with the
state "Failure", but AceXpander still proceeds expanding the next archive.

If you click on the "Cancel" button, AceXpander stops working as soon as
possible. Usually, the archive that was being processed when you clicked
on "Cancel" is marked with the state "Aborted". You will have to check
in the Finder whether or not any of the archive's content has been
extracted already.

Should you have placed too many files into the table, you may remove some or
all of them. Use the "Remove" or "Remove all" commands from the Edit menu.
"Remove" will only remove the files that are selected.

Instead of removing files, you could also prevent AceXpander from
processing some of them. Select those files that you do not want to be
processed and use the "Unqueue" command from the Edit menu. The items
will be marked with the state "Skip". Note: "Unqueue" only works for
files that have the state "Queued".

If you accidentally click on the "Expand selected" button a second time,
after archives have already been expanded, nothing happens. This is
because AceXpander only processes files that have the state "Queued",
and those files that have already been processed now have the state
"Success" or "Failure" (or "Aborted", if you pressed the "Cancel" button).

If you want to expand an archive a second time (e.g. because the archive
failed to expand the first time, and you have remedied the situation in
the meantime), select the archive file in the table and use the "Requeue"
command from the Edit menu. Whatever state the file is in, the command
resets it back to the state "Queued" so that you can have another go.

When an archive has failed to expand, you might get a hint about the
reason for the failure if you look at the result window (open it from
the Window menu). The result window only displays information if a single
file is selected in the main window's table. To view information about
multiple files, you must select one file after the other - the result
window will update its information to match the currently selected file.

The result window contains two text boxes that show the messages printed
by the unace process on the standard output and standard error,
respectively (if you do not know what these are, think of them as
"normal output" and "error output"). In case of a failure, the standard
error box may contain some useful information about the nature of the
failure.

So far the discussion was about 1) manually adding files to the table in
the main window, 2) selecting, and 3) expanding them. This process is
actually quite tedious and you will not normally use AceXpander like
this. The more common case is that you just double-click on an ACE
archive in the Finder. AceXpander will launch, add the file to the main
window's table, and process it. After it has successfully expanded the
archive, it will terminate.

ACE archives that are double-clickable in the Finder are files that have the
extension ".ace". If you ever have an ACE archive without the extension, you
can either rename it and add the extension, or you can launch AceXpander
and process the file manually. Neither the File-Open command nor dragging
to the main window's table are restricted to files with the ".ace"
extension.

If AceXpander encounters an error after you have launched it by
double-clicking on an ACE archive in the Finder, it does not terminate
automatically. Rather it remains launched so that you may inspect the result
window to identify the error.


Preferences
-----------
An important setting that you can change in the Preferences dialog is 
the location where an archive's content should be placed upon expansion.
This location is called the destination folder. You can choose from three
locations:
- the same folder as the archive's
- a destination folder that you choose once in the Preferences dialog
- AceXpander lets you choose a destination folder each time an archive
  is expanded
You can combine these with the option to let AceXpander create a folder
for each archive that it is expanding and to place the archive's content
within that folder. This so-called "surrounding folder" is created inside
the destination folder.

If you turn on the preference item "Look into folders" and then open a
folder in AceXpander, the application will recursively scan that folder
and all its sub-folders for ACE archives. By default, it will only accept
files with the file name extension ".ace" as valid ACE archives during
such a scan, however you may turn on the preference item
"Treat all files as ACE archives" to make AceXpander accept all files.
Note: this preference item does not affect the opening of individual
files with AceXpander, the item only affects the "Look into folders"
feature.

All other items in the Preferences dialog should be self-explaining and are
not discussed in this document.

In addition to the items in the Preferences dialog, the following things are
stored in the user preferences file
(~/Library/Preferences/ch.herzbube.acexpander.plist):

- the sizes and positions of the main window and the result window when
  the application is terminated
- whether or not the result window is visible when the application is
  terminated
- if you select "Remember as my defaults" from the Options menu, the
  current option settings are stored in the user preferences file (with the
  exception of the password, which is too sensitive to be kept in a clear text
  preferences file)
- the last directory you selected in the File-Open dialog
- the last items you opened in AceXpander (see the "Open Recent" sub-menu
  in the File menu)


Expand options
--------------
The following items from the Options menu pertain to the "Expand" command
of AceXpander.

- Overwrite files
  If a file is extracted from an archive, but this file already exists,
  the expansion process will fail for that archive. If you turn on the
  "Overwrite files" option, however, the expansion process will succeed,
  because any existing files will be overwritten. This is a somewhat
  dangerous option and therefore turned off by default.
  Note 1: due to a bug in unace the "Assume yes" option is always turned
  on automatically by AceXpander when you turn on "Overwrite files".
  When you turn off "Overwrite files" you must turn off "Assume yes"
  manually.
  Note 2: due to a bug in unace, the "Overwrite files" option has no effect
  on directories, i.e. if a directory exists both in an archive and in the
  file system, the expansion process always fails.
- Extract with full path
  Use this option if the archive was created using a directory structure
  and you want to restore this directory structure. The option is turned
  on by default.
- Assume yes
  Use this option to tell unace that it should assume you would answer
  "yes" to any questions it could ask. This is especially useful for
  AceXpander, because AceXpander insulates you from unace and any
  questions it could ask: if you notice in the result window that unace
  wants to ask you questions, it might be appropriate to turn this option
  on. Because "Assume yes" takes away control from the user this option
  is turned off by default.
- Use password
  Choose this option if you need to expand an archive that contains
  password-protected files. A dialog will pop up where you can enter
  a password. If you cancel the dialog, the "Use password" option remains
  turned off. Otherwise it becomes turned on and AceXpander will remember
  to use the password you entered for all subsequent expand operations.
  Turn off the option if you want AceXpander to forget the password. This
  option is turned off by default.
  Note: the password will be passed to unace as a command line argument
  in clear text. If someone watches your system's process list that person
  might be able to catch the password as it is part of the unace command
  line.


Listing and testing
-------------------
The previous sections described how AceXpander performs its main function,
i.e. expanding ACE archives. There are two more modes of operation:

- Instead of expanding an archive you may list its contents. Select the
  archive and choose the command "List content" from the Commands menu.
  The archive's contents could be listed if its processing state becomes
  "Success". The archive's contents could not be listed if its state
  becomes "Failure".
  
  The list of contents is available in its raw form in the standard output
  text box in the result window. It is however recommended to use the
  drawer on the bottom of the main window for a nicer view of the content
  list. The drawer can be toggled by the corresponding show/hide button;
  it is not visible by default.

  You may modify how the "List content" command works by turning on one
  or both of the options "Show comments" and "List verbosely". If you
  don't see any difference in the output, the archive has no comments
  and no special content that could be listed verbosely.

- Instead of expanding an archive you may test it for integrity. Select
  the archive and choose the command "Test integrity" from the Commands
  menu. The archive passes the integrity check if its processing state
  becomes "Success". The archive fails the check if its state becomes
  "Failure".
