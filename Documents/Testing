Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document lists formal test cases that need to be executed manually.
If in the future the project is fitted with unit tests, this document should
be extended to include information about them.


Formal test cases
-----------------
A formal test case can be referenced by its unique ID. It states the test's
purpose, which should be taken in consideration when formulating variations.
Before execution of a test case starts, its precondition(s) must be met. The
test case is executed by performing all its actions in the listed order. After
execution stops, the test case post condition(s) must be met. To reduce the
number of test cases, a test case may be formulated with variations that share
the same general test purpose. For each variation, the test case is executed
one additional time. The variation exactly states the modifications that the
tester must make to precondition(s), actions and postcondition(s).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Test ID: 1
Purpose: Successful automatic expanding, with terminating application
Precondition:
- The application is not started
- User default StartExpandingAfterLaunch is set to true
- User default QuitAfterExpand is set to true
Actions:
- Double-click one valid .ace archive in the Finder
Postcondition:
- The archive is expanded successfully
- The application terminates
Variations:
- Select and double-click more than 1 .ace archive in the Finder. All
  archives are expanded successfully and the application terminates
- Drag one valid .ace archive from the Finder and drop it on the
  application's icon in the Dock. The archive is expanded successfully and
  the application terminates

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Test ID: 2
Purpose: Successful automatic expanding, without terminating application
Precondition:
- The application is not started
- User default StartExpandingAfterLaunch is set to true
- User default QuitAfterExpand is set to false
Actions:
- Double-click one valid .ace archive in the Finder
Postcondition:
- The archive is expanded successfully
- The application does not terminate
Variations:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Test ID: 3
Purpose: Unsuccessful automatic expanding
Precondition:
- The application is not started
- User default StartExpandingAfterLaunch is set to true
- User default QuitAfterExpand is set to true
- User default AlwaysQuitAfterExpand is set to false
Actions:
- Double-click one corrupt .ace archive in the Finder
Postcondition:
- The archive is not expanded
- The application does not terminate
Variations:
- User default AlwaysQuitAfterExpand is set to false. The application
  terminates after the failed expanding attempt.

Test ID: 4
Purpose: Drag&drop functionality
Precondition:
Actions:
Postcondition:
Variations:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Test ID: 5
Purpose: Keeping of menu File-OpenRecent
Precondition:
- The application is running
- The menu File-OpenRecent is empty
Actions:
- Double-click one .ace archive in the Finder
Postcondition:
- The File-OpenRecent menu contains the filename of the archive
Variations:
- Drag one .ace archive from the Finder and drop it on the application's
  icon in the dock. The same postconditions apply
- Drag one .ace archive from the Finder and drop it on the table inside the
  application's main window. The same postconditions apply
- Use the menu command File-Open to open one .ace archive. The same
  postconditions apply
