Wed Sep 02 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- [project] project has moved from Subversion to Git (includes replacing all
  references to Subversion with references to Git, and adding .gitignore)
- [project] updated all references to project website so that they now point
  to the correct URL http://www.herzbube.ch/acexpander

Thu Nov 23 2006   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- added context menu to main table
- menu items "requeue all", "unqueue all" and "remove all" are now disabled
  if table does not contain any items at all
- removed invisible button from the .nib that allowed the user to remove items
  from the table with the backspace key; this hack is no longer necessary since
  Interface Builder now allows to assign a keyboard shortcut to a menu item
  that has no command key modifier
- added new "Doxygen" target to Xcode project (Menu "Project", item
  "New target", Type "Shell script target"), then moved the "run doxygen" build
  phase from the "AceXpander" to the new "Doxygen" target
- released version 1.1

Thu Nov 16 2006   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- removed shell script frontend to the unace binary, AceXpander now executes
  the unace binary directly in an NSTask
- removed "Debug mode" item from the Options menu; this mode is no longer
  available because the shell script frontend no longer exists

Wed Nov 15 2006   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- fixed a nasty bug where unace would hang when AceXpander was launched
  from the Finder
  - this bug is present in 1.0.2, which makes the release all but useless :-(
  - I was completely clueless what was going on until I found the crucial hint
    at the following URL
    http://forum.macbidouille.com/lofiversion/index.php/t53823.html
  - thanks a lot to the author of iUnacer (another unace GUI frontend that
    seems to be no longer available)
- moved NSTask related stuff from AceXpanderThread to new class AceXpanderTask
- moved all constants from various .h and .m files to new file
  AceXpanderGlobals.h
- AceXpanderThread is now a proper thread with a main method that sleeps
  until it gets new items to process

Sat Nov 11 2006   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- bug fixed where command thread seemed to run forever when no item was
  selected and the "expand" button was clicked

  on application shutdown

Mon Nov 06 2006   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- any command that is still running is now cancelled when the application
