  entries in the ChangeLog
- bump the version number
  - in InfoPlist.strings in the Resources section
  - in ProjectBuilder on the "Targets" pane under "InfoPlist Entries"

  - switch build style to deployment and build target
  - if build is successful, the binary is now in the "build" folder
    which is a sub-folder of the project folder
  - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! make a basic sanity test !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - launch disk copy
  - create a new emty disk image with the following properties:
    - Mac OS Extended
    - an appropriate size (usually the minimal 5 MB should suffice)
    - a volume name that matches the product and version number
    - a file name that matches the volume name
  - drag the built application into the volume that was automatically
    mounted from the disk image
  - un-mount the disk image
  - in disk copy, choose the "convert image" command. Choose "compressed"
    as the new image format.
  - the new image is compressed and read-only; it can now be distributed
- to distribute sources
  - go to terminal
  - call "<path-to-project-folder>/distribute.sh 0.9"
  - a tarball is created which can now be distributed; it is placed in the
    same folder where the project folder is
