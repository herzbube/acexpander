Perform the following steps to make a release
- update the ChangeLog (should have been done continuously, anyway)
- replace the "Changes in this release" section of the README with a collection
  of the most important entries from the ChangeLog
- update the table "Acexpander releases vs. Mac OS X versions" in the README
- bump the version number and the copyright year
  - in the README file
  - in the Info.plist file change the property list keys
    "CFBundleShortVersionString" and (if necessary) "NSHumanReadableCopyright"
- set active build configuration in Xcode to "Release" and build target
- perform tests suitable to make sure that everything still works as intended
  -> DO THIS OUTSIDE OF THE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (= Xcode), i.e. launch the
     application from the Finder (yes, this can have an impact - for instance
     NSTask objects do not get automatic connections to stdin when the
     application is launched from the Finder)
  -> see the Testing document for possible tests
- source control
  - commit all changes
    cd <projectdir>
    git add .
	git commit
	git push
  - tag the release
    cd <projectdir>
    git tag -s -m "tagging release x.y" x.y <commit hash>
- to make the binary distribution
  - launch disk copy
  - create a new empty disk image with the following properties:
    - Mac OS Extended
    - an appropriate size (usually the minimal 5 MB should suffice)
    - a volume name that matches the product and version number
    - a file name that matches the volume name
  - drag the built application into the volume that was automatically
    mounted from the disk image
  - un-mount the disk image
  - in disk copy, choose the "convert image" command. Choose "compressed"
    as the new image format.
  - the new image is compressed and read-only; it can now be distributed
- to make the source distribution
  - go to terminal
  - call "<path-to-project-folder>/distribute.sh 0.9"
    (example creates distribution for version 0.9; note: the project folder
    is temporarily renamed by the script while it is running!)
  - a tarball is created which can now be distributed; it is placed in the
    same folder that contains the project folder
- to make the distributions available on the Web
  - create a new directory in the public web space
  - copy ChangeLog, README, disk image file (.dmg) and tar ball (.tar.gz)
    into the new directory
  - update disk image and tar ball symlinks in the "current" directory
  - update web content
