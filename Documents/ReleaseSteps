Perform the following steps to make a release
- perform tests suitable to make sure that everything still works as
  intended
- update the ChangeLog (should have been done continuously, anyway)
- replace the "Changes in this release" section of the README with a collection
  of the most important entries from the ChangeLog
- bump the version number and the copyright year
  - in the README file
  - in Xcode choose the menu item "Project" -> "Edit active target", then
    select the "InfoPlist Entries", then change the property list keys
    "CFBundleShortVersionString" and "NSHumanReadableCopyright"
- source control
  - commit all changes
    - CVS
      cd <projectdir>
      cvs commit
    - Subversion
      cd <projectdir>
      svn commit
  - tag the release
    - CVS
      cd <basedir>
      cvs tag v0-5 .
    - Subversion
      ???
- to make the binary distribution
  - switch build style to "deployment" and build target
  - if build is successful, the binary is now in the "build" folder
    which is a sub-folder of the project folder
  - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! make a basic sanity test !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    you want to be sure that the "deployment" version works as well as the
    debug version
  - launch disk copy
  - create a new empty disk image with the following properties:
    - Mac OS Extended
    - an appropriate size (usually the minimal 5 MB should suffice)
    - a volume name that matches the product and version number
    - a file name that matches the volume name
  - drag the built application into the volume that was automatically
    mounted from the disk image
  - un-mount the disk image
  - in disk copy, choose the "convert image" command. Choose "compressed"
    as the new image format.
  - the new image is compressed and read-only; it can now be distributed
- to make the source distribution
  - go to terminal
  - call "<path-to-project-folder>/distribute.sh 0.9"
    (example creates distribution for version 0.9; note: the project folder
    is temporarily renamed by the script while it is running!)
  - a tarball is created which can now be distributed; it is placed in the
    same folder that contains the project folder
