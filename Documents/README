Introduction
------------
AceXpander is a Mac OS X graphical user interface to the unace command line
utility. With AceXpander installed, you can simply double-click on any
ACE archive(s) in the Finder and the contents of the archive will be
extracted to a sub-folder of the same folder where the original archive
is located. To configure AceXpander, or to use additional program features,
you have to launch the application, e.g. by double-clicking on the application
icon in the Finder or in the Dock.

For a detailed description of AceXpander's features, see the MANUAL
document (available from AceXpander's Help menu).

ACE archives can only be created with WinAce. For more information about
this Windows application, see http://www.winace.com.

You can check for the most recent version of AceXpander on its homepage
http://www.herzbube.ch/acexpander.

If you are interested in AceXpander as a developer, you should have a look
at the README.developer document.


Changes in this release (1.1)
-------------------------------
- fixed a nasty bug where unace would hang when AceXpander was launched
  from the Finder; this bug is present in 1.0.2, which makes the release all
  but useless :-(
- added context menu to main table
- removed "Debug mode" item from the Options menu; this mode is no longer
  available because the unace binary is now executed without an in-between
  helper shell script
- bug fixed where command thread seemed to run forever when no item was
  selected and the "expand" button was clicked
- expand button is now disabled if no archive is selected
- any command that is still running is now cancelled when the application
  terminates (this fixes a bug where AceXpander would leave a still running
  command hanging around as an orphaned process)
- improved the "About" panel

For more details see the ChangeLog document.


License and source code
-----------------------
AceXpander is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv2). See
the file COPYING inside the application bundle, or start the application
and choose the appropriate item in the Help menu to view the detailed
license.

The source code for AceXpander can be downloaded from its homepage
http://www.herzbube.ch/acexpander. You will get the source files
ready for building with Xcode. Alternatively you may browse through the
source code online (http://www.herzbube.ch/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi/dgsmonx.git)
or clone the Git repository (http://herzbube.ch/git/dgsmonx.git).


unace binary
------------
AceXpander packages its own version of the unace binary so that it can
be distributed and run as a stand-alone application. If you wish you
may set your own version of unace in the Preferences dialog, however you
should be aware that AceXpander may stop working properly after you make
this change, because AceXpander makes a number of assumptions about how
unace is working, which command line switches and options it uses, and
how its output on stdout is formatted.

Of course you can always change your preferences back to use the unace
that was packaged with this application.


Platforms
---------
I develop and test AceXpander with whatever version of Mac OS X is installed
on my system at home, so every release of AceXpander potentially runs only
on exactly one version of Mac OS X: the one that was installed at my home at
the time of release. Since minor versions of the OS are often not that
different from each other, it is reasonable to expect that AceXpander runs on
earlier minor versions of the OS than the one that it was released for (e.g.
a release for Mac OS X 10.4.6 may also run on 10.4.3). In effect, you will
just have to try out whether it works or not.

The following table lists what versions of Mac OS X I had installed at the
time when I made a release of AceXpander. It also has a very rough guess on
what the minimum requirements are to run the release. If you find the guess to
be incorrect, please let me know and I will update the table.

--------------------------------------------------
AceXpander   Mac OS X installed   Mac OS X minimum
--------------------------------------------------
0.9          10.2.8 (?)           10.2
0.9.1        n/a                  10.2
1.0          n/a                  10.2
1.0.1        10.4.6 (?)           10.2
1.0.2        10.4.8               10.3
1.1          10.4.8               10.3
--------------------------------------------------

Starting with release 1.0.2, AceXpander is available as a universal binary.
Although the same is not true for the unace utility bundled with AceXpander
(it's still a PowerPC binary), you should nevertheless be able to run unace on
MacIntel machines thanks to Apple's Rosetta technology.


Limitations of AceXpander
-------------------------
- If you turn on the "Use password" option, the password you enter will
  be passed to unace in clear text. If someone watches your system's
  process list that person might be able to catch the password as it is part
  of the unace command line.

- AceXpander has too many features. I try to keep them down to a reasonable
  number, but as this is a learning project for me, I often just can't resist...


Limitations of unace
--------------------
- If you try to extract a password-protected file but specify an incorrect
  password, unace first extracts the encrypted file from the archive, but
  is then unable to decrypt the file, and dies. Unfortunately, the
  encrypted file is left lying around for you to clean up :-(

- If you try to extract a file without the overwrite option turned on, and
  a file with the same name already exists, unace dies with a segmentation
  fault. In combination with the above problem with password-protected
  files, this may prove to be quite nasty. Imagine this situation:
  1) In your first try to extract a password-protected file, you mistype
     the password and get an error message.
  2) In your second try, you type the correct password, but you still get
     an error message. Reason: you didn't turn on the overwrite option,
     but there is still the encrypted file from 1) lying around. After
     a couple of tries you might start to think that you have the wrong
     password, but in effect you just have to delete a file, or turn on
     overwrite.

- If you try to extract a file with the overwrite option turned on, and
  a file with the same name already exists, you must also have the
  "assume yes" option turned on in AceXpander, otherwise unace dies with a
  segmentation fault. AceXpander takes care of this problem for you by
  always turning on the "assume yes" option when the overwrite option is
  turned on.

  Technical note: the problem actually exists because of how AceXpander
  interacts with unace: when invoking unace, AceXpander explicitly sets all
  possible switches on the unace command line, even if the specified setting
  is the default for unace and therefore could be omitted (the reason why
  I coded it like this is that I did not want AceXpander to have specific
  knowledge about unace defaults; the less AceXpander knows about unace,
  the better).
  Now for the "assume yes" option: as explained, even though the option is
  turned off in the GUI, and "off" is unace's default for the switch,
  AceXpander still explicitly sets the switch on the command line to "-y-".
  Now the bug in unace is that the overwrite switch stops working as soon as
  "-y-" is set explicitly; if "-y-" is not set explicitly, the overwrite
  switch works fine.

- If the archive contains a directory, and a directory with the same name
  already exists in the file system, unace is not able to extract the
  directory and its content - even if the overwrite option is turned on.

- Often when unace encounters an error, it dies with a segmentation fault. This
  is not a big problem, the error handling on the part of AceXpander just
  becomes somewhat un-differentiated. If you're only using the GUI and are not
  interested in what happens under the hood of AceXpander, you can forget
  about this issue.


Personal note
-------------
I would like to thank Marcel Lemke for providing us with unace, and Kolja
Koischwitz for porting unace to the Mac. I would also like to mention
another GUI frontend to unace, MacUnace by Gabriel Gritsch, which has
influenced some of AceXpander's features (http://www.gritsch-soft.com/).
Martin Moser has contributed the project logo and the important parts of the
application and document icons; for this I am very grateful since I am a most
un-artistic person.

And, of course, a big Thanks to you for trying out this little program. It
is my first Cocoa application, and in fact, it is also the first Open
Source software that I release. As such it is probably full of shortcomings,
if not bugs. If you see something that needs improvement, please don't
hesitate to let me know.
