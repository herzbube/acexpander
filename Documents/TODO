Priority 1 (important)
----------------------
- table should color-code states
- should be possible to change state by clicking on the table cell
- email to kolja/marcel lemke about following issues:
  - unace bugs
  - ask them about why MacAce packages unace version 2.5i (I have a MacAce
    version sent to me by Gabriel for testing, even though MacAce nowadays
    seems to be off-line), but the unace version that can be downloaded from
    the official winace.com site is only 2.5
- find out where the null pointer exception hides. must have something
  to do with expanding/cancelling expansion; maybe also when items were
  deleted and expansion follows afterwards with new items; or simply when
  there are two items, and one or both are already processed
- replaced unace binary by a binary with version 2.5i, ripped from the
  MacAce application by Gabriel Gritsch (http://gritsch-soft.com/)


Priority 2 (nice to have)
-------------------------
- folders should be ignored with drag&drop
- throw an exception when anything goes wrong with loading the
  NSRegistration domain defaults
- throw exception when shared NSUserDefaults object is null in
  AceExpanderPreferences()
- throw exception when error occurs during AceExpanderThread.setArguments()
- throw exception when state of AceExpanderItem is set to something
  invalid
- throw exception when AceExpanderItem is created with theModel == null
- throw exception when AceExpanderThread is created with theModel == null
- better file handling when a new item is created or its filename is
  set: e.g. what happens when it's a symlink? when it's an alias?
  when we don't have read permissions?  
- Double click on table item expands it
- write the "what is it all about" paragraph in README
- show spinning cursor while application launches
- entire path should be shown in tooltip for items in preferences dialog

Priority 3 (not important)
--------------------------
- invisible button should not receive mouse clicks
- preferences: reset to factory settings -> removes all defaults in the
  application domain
- show main window when it is hidden and the user clicks on the
  application's dock icon
- delete key should also remove selected items
- process file URLs, file contents (what's that?), file promises
  (what's that?)
- check the dragging source's operation mask
- read Human Interface Guidelines
- when the user chooses the unace executable in the preferences dialog,
  a check should be made if the chosen file really is executable.
  This seems to be not so easy in Java, although in Obj-C the class
  NSFileManager can be used (isExecutableFileAtPath)
- show an icon in the preferences in the popup button for selecting the
  unace executable
- find out what the following message in the ProjectBuilder output window
  means:
  2004-06-18 03:10:48.430 AceExpander[1018] *** _NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x15dd310 of class NSCFArray autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking
  

Mac OS X 10.3
-------------
- when changing to Mac OS X 10.3, the following deprecated things
  should be corrected:
  - in the model: NSTableView.selectedRowEnumerator() should be replaced by
    NSTableView.selectedRowIndexes()
  - in the model: NSTableView.selectRow() should be replaced by
    NSTableView.selectRowIndexes()
- in Mac OS X 10.3, use Cocoa bindings to manage preferences. See
  http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/cocoabindings.html
