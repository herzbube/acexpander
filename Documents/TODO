Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document contains a list of minor features and technical stuff that
should be implemented when time permits it. The TODO list is updated
frequently as new ideas crop up during programming.

For a broader view of how the application will develop over time, you
should see the ReleasePlan document.


Priority 1 (important)
----------------------
- better "list archive" concept:
  - when the user selects a single item for the first time, spawn a
    background thread and process in the background
  - if the drawer is open, indicate the scan-in-progress by a spinner
  - if the scan fails, indicate this
  - when the scan finishes, notify the controller so that it can
    give the table a hint to update itself
  - when a single item is selected, show the cached content list
  - provide an update button, so that the user can update the list
  - still an option "verbose?" -> probably yes
- fix the icon column in the main table
- when the user is asked to select a destination folder and she clicks "cancel",
  the entire expand batch should be cancelled (currently the user is prompted
  again and again for the destination folder)
- after selecting File-Open (and possibly other menu commands), the table
  should get the focus automatically so that Cmd-A can immediately select
  all items, without having to use the mouse to give the focus to the
  table
- add basic file checks (exists, readable) to AceXpanderThread; this
  will provide better error handling than what unace can provide; it
  will also prevent the unnecessary creation of a folder when the archive
  file does not exist or cannot be read


Priority 2 (nice to have)
-------------------------
- when user is asked to select a destination folder, the file panel should
  display a button that lets the user create a new folder
- table should be highlighted in some way while a valid drag hovers over it
- better file handling when a new item is created or its filename is
  set: e.g. what happens when it's a symlink? when it's an alias?
  when we don't have read permissions?  
- double click on table item expands it
- show spinning cursor while application launches
- entire path should be shown in tooltip for items in preferences dialog
- cancel button should become default button ("Enter" button) while
  expansion is in progress
- make dialogs/windows smaller so that the application is less intrusive
  on the user's desktop
  - only show archive filename, not entire archive path; add path to
    tooltips
- if no files are added as a result of opening a folder with AceXpander,
  the user should be notified of this instead of just silently ignoring
  the folder
- if "LookIntoFolders" is turned off, drag&drop and File-Open should
  not accept folders
- it should be possible to drag folders onto the application icon in the
  Finder/Dock
- display spinning cursor while recursively scanning folders
  - give user ability to interrupt this process
- user default: "ignore dot files" (becomes available and immediately selected
  when "treat all files as archives" is enabled)

Priority 3 (not important)
--------------------------
- user default: set the number of documents in the File-OpenRecent menu
- create test files that produce comments, that can be listed verbosely,
  and that require the "assume yes" option.
- user default: stop processing when a failure occurs
- preferences dialog: reset to factory settings -> removes all defaults in
  the application domain
- show main window when it is hidden and the user clicks on the
  application's dock icon
- delete key should behave like backspace key (i.e. it should remove
  selected items)
- when the user chooses the unace executable in the preferences dialog,
  a check should be made if the chosen file really is executable.
  This seems to be not so easy in Java, although in Obj-C the class
  NSFileManager can be used (isExecutableFileAtPath)
- show an icon in the preferences in the popup button for selecting the
  unace executable and the destination folder
- if a filename in the content list drawer starts with "*" it's password
  protected -> mark the file as such
- if the content list drawer or the result window don't show anything
  because the user selected more than one item -> indicate this somehow
- write drawer state (hidden/shown) to user defaults
- f/x switches: select items in the drawer with the content list
  expands only these items

Mac OS X 10.3
-------------
- in Mac OS X 10.3, use Cocoa bindings to manage preferences. See
