Priority 1 (important)
----------------------
- display stdout/stderr messages
- if no items are selected and new items are added to the table,
  these new items should become selected
- table should color-code states
- should be possible to change state by clicking on the table cell
- file-open: remember the last directory in the user preferences
- email to kolja/marcel lemke about unace bugs

Priority 2 (nice to have)
-------------------------
- folders should be ignored with drag&drop
- throw an exception when anything goes wrong with loading the
  NSRegistration domain defaults
- throw exception when shared NSUserDefaults object is null in
  AceExpanderPreferences()
- throw exception when error occurs during AceExpanderThread.setArguments()
- throw exception when state of AceExpanderItem is set to something
  invalid
- throw exception when AceExpanderItem is created with theModel == null
- throw exception when AceExpanderThread is created with theModel == null
- better file handling when a new item is created or its filename is
  set: e.g. what happens when it's a symlink? when it's an alias?
  when we don't have read permissions?  
- AceExpanderThread should not know the model -> should get the
  information about options etc. differently
- Double click on table item expands it
- write the "what is it all about" paragraph in README

Priority 3 (not important)
--------------------------
- main window resize
- preferences: reset to factory settings -> removes all defaults in the
  application domain
- show main window when it is hidden and the user clicks on the
  application's dock icon
- delete key should also remove selected items
- process file URLs, file contents (what's that?), file promises
  (what's that?)
- check the dragging source's operation mask
- read Human Interface Guidelines

Mac OS X 10.3
-------------
- when changing to Mac OS X 10.3, the following deprecated things
  should be corrected:
  - in the model: NSTableView.selectedRowEnumerator() should be replaced by
    NSTableView.selectedRowIndexes()
- in Mac OS X 10.3, use Cocoa bindings to manage preferences. See
  http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/cocoabindings.html
