Binary installation
--------------------
If you don't want to build AceExpander from source by yourself, just
follow these steps:

- download the installation disk image (.dmg file) of the version of
  AceExpander you wish to install from the download section of the
  AceExpander homepage
- open the disk image with Apple's Disk Copy programm
- in the Finder, drag the application icon to any location on one of your
  volumes
- the application is now being copied, that's all, folks :-)

If you want to completely remove AceExpander from your system, simply
delete the application and the associated user defaults file
~/Library/Preferences/ch.herzbube.aceexpander.plist
(the tilde sign "~" stands for your user home directory) 

Source installation
-------------------
Get the tar ball containing the sources of the version of AceExpander
you wish to build from the download section of the AceExpander homepage.

The tar ball will expand into its own sub-directory. The source files
are located in the Sources sub-directory (duh!).

To build AceExpander, first launch ProjectBuilder by double-clicking on the
.pbproj file in the Finder. The project contains only one target, but you
may choose between one of the build-styles "Development" and "Deployment".
Unless you want to do some programming and test your changes, you should
choose "Deployment" build style. Now you can choose "Build", or
"Build and Run" from the Build menu.

AceExpander should build without errors. If it doesn't, please let me know
so that I may correct the error in the project settings for future releases.
After the build has finished, the application can be found in the project
directory's sub-folder "build".
