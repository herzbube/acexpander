- the .nib uses the format for Mac OS X 10.2 and later. Therefore (but
  also because various Cocoa classes available only on 10.2 or later are
  used) the application will not run on pre-10.2 systems
- it is by design that the table cannot be sorted, otherwise the
  row index could not be guaranteed to match the correct item in the
  model's item list
- the MainWindow instance icon in MainMenu.nib indicates that a child
  has a bad/missing connection. This is normal: there is no connection
  for the target of the NSTextField instance that acts as a label for the
  table
- When the application is run from ProjectBuilder, Cocoa prints out the
  following warning to the application's output window when the
  variant of NSOpenPanel.runModalInDirectory() is invoked where the parent
  window can be specified and the open panel is opened as a sheet:
  
  *** WARNING: Method runModalForDirectory:file:types:relativeToWindow: in class NSOpenPanel is obsolete and will be removed in release GM ***

- AceExpanderModel.setInteractive(true) should be called only during the
  application's launch sequence, or right after an initial expand thread
  has finished.
- it is important that AceExpanderPreferences is created at the earliest
  possible time so that it can set up the user defaults database for the
  other classes to use
- OpenRecent: the maximum number of entries in the OpenRecent menu is
  determined by the value of the user default NSRecentDocumentsLimit. The
  value is of type Integer.
