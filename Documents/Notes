- the .nib uses the format for Mac OS X 10.2 and later. Therefore (but
  also because various Cocoa classes available only on 10.2 or later are
  used) the application will not run on pre-10.2 systems
- it is by design that the table cannot be sorted, otherwise the
  row index could not be guaranteed to match the correct item in the
  model's item list
- the MainWindow instance icon in MainMenu.nib indicates that a child
  has a bad/missing connection. This is normal: there is no connection
  for the target of the NSTextField instance that acts as a label for the
  table
