/// @brief The AceXpanderThread class encapsulates access to the unace binary,
/// either the one that is included with the application as a resource, or the
/// one that the user specifies in the user preferences dialog.
///
/// The main function of AceXpanderThread is to execute all the possible unace
/// commands, using the unace binary that it encapsulates. It does so by
/// spawning a new thread and executing the command in that thread's context.
/// The GUI thereby remains responsive to any user requests, especially to
/// stop the currently running command.
///
/// Before any command can be executed, at least one archive item must have
/// been added to this thread with addItem:(). In addition, the setCommand:()
/// message must have been sent at least once so that a correct command line can
/// be built using the supplied arguments.
///
/// When all pre-conditions have been met, command execution can be started by
/// sending the run:() message. This will launch the new thread, which will then
/// iterate all archive items previously added and try to process those that
/// have their state set to #QueuedState. For each item, a new system process is
/// launched that executes the unace binary with the command (i.e. expand, list,
/// test) specified through setArguments:(). The process is run synchronously,
/// i.e. the thread waits for it to complete before it processes the next item.
///
/// After all items were processed, the notification
/// #commandThreadHasFinishedNotification is posted to the application's default
/// notification centre and the thread exits. To interrupt the thread while it
/// is still processing items, a client may send the message stopRunning:().
/// The thread then tries to stop its operation as soon as possible.
///
/// Items are updated with results as soon as their system process exits. Items
/// are responsible for making these results visible to the user.
